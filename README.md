# Extrovert vs. Introvert Personality Classification ðŸ§ ðŸŽ­

This project aims to predict personality types (Extrovert or Introvert) using behavioral and social activity data. It explores how features like time spent alone, social event attendance, and stage fear correlate with personality classification.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `Extrovert_vs_Introvert_Behavior_Data.ipynb`: The full notebook with EDA, preprocessing, and model building.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries.

## Key Highlights
- Data cleaning and missing value treatment
- Exploratory analysis of social indicators and behavioral traits
- Binary classification using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other models
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Features Used
- Time spent alone
- Stage fear
- Social event attendance
- Frequency of going outside
- Post frequency on social media
- Drained feeling after socializing
- Size of friend circle

## Outcome
Built a classifier to predict whether a person is an introvert or extrovert with solid evaluation metrics and insights.
